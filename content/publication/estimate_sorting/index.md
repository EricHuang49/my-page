abstract: "In this paper we identify labor market sorting in an environment where workers and firms form matches based on unobserved (to economists) characteristics and where nonproductive characteristics (such as wealth) play a role in their matching decisions, based on the method developed by Hagedorn, Law and Manovskii (2017)."
