abstract: "This paper aims to provide a theoretical foundation for the empirical observation in the housing market that a small number of speculators, or “flippers” contributed to a large portion of the increase in house prices and transactions during the 2003-2006 housing boom. We extend the search framework of Duffie, Garleanu and Pederson (2007) by introducing an additional type of agents who act like house flippers, in the sense that they purchase from sellers with low valuation of their houses and sell quickly to buyers with high valuation. As they spend most of their time on the market as speculative buyers, they reduce search frictions for sellers but increase search frictions for buyers. We show that under a reasonable set of parameter values, a small increase in the measure of flippers can lead to a reduction in housing vacancy and the average time of house posting on the market, as well as a significant increase in average prices. Moreover, these flippers are able to buy at below-average prices and sell at above-average prices, effectively generating a house price spread within the market."
