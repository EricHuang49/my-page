I am a Ph.D. candidate in economics at University of Pennsylvania. My research interest focuses on the macroeconomic implications of inequality.

My job market paper studies how allocative efficiency in the labor market can be influenced by households' precautionary motive.

I am on the 2022/2023 job market.
